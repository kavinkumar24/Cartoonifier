# Cartoonifier
In this Project the main objective is to create a sketched image from normal 
image and can also smooth the image in any image of jpg and png formats. This 
is helpful on generating the sketch of any image given to the system and also 
helpful in Changing background of the image with any color.
Algorithms:
• Numpy
• Imageio
• Matplot.lib
• Tkinter
• Open source cv2
• Smooth Gray scale


The generated sketched image from a real time image is automatically saved in
folder. This module can be highly recommended for use in cartoon industry to 
frame the cartoon characters and build anime series in short duration than the 
current conventional approach.

In this project i use the computer vision (open cv), it means OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects, extract 3D models of objects, produce 3D point clouds from stereo cameras, stitch images together to produce a high resolution image of an entire scene, find similar images from an image database, remove red eyes from images taken using flash, follow eye movements, recognize scenery and establish markers to overlay it with augmented reality, etc. OpenCV has more than 47 thousand people of user community and estimated number of downloads exceeding 18 million. The library is used extensively in companies, research groups and by governmental bodies.
